            <h2>Hi, I'm Tomás Venegas Osses</h2>
            <p>I'm 22 years old and a student of software development. I've been passionate about this field since I was young. My interest in design spans from how I dress to color palettes, textures, and sensations. This is probably why I enjoy photo editing, video editing, fashion, colors, and art. I’ve been learning to develop websites, and though I haven’t been doing it long, I love how writing lines of code can create shapes, animations, and designs.</p>
            <h3>About My Country – Chile</h3>
            <p>I'm from Chile, the southernmost country in the world! Due to its unique geography, Chile has a variety of climates, from the driest desert in the world in the north to glaciers in the far south. I love the food, culture, language, and traditions of my country. From delicious empanadas to vibrant festivals, there's so much to appreciate. I hope one day people who haven’t visited Chile get the chance to experience its beauty and warmth.</p>

        <h2>WDD131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>Following the foundations, this course introduced me to JavaScript and its essential role in creating interactive websites. I practiced using variables, loops, functions, and events to bring web pages to life. It was exciting to see how simple scripts could change the way a site behaves, and it deepened my understanding of programming logic and problem-solving.</p>
